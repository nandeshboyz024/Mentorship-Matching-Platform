Task Overview:
You are required to build a "Mentorship Matching Platform" where users can create an account, set up a profile as a mentor or mentee, specify their skills or areas of interest, and find matches with others for mentorship opportunities.

Requirements:
User Interface (UI) Design:
Design: Create a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface using an existing CSS library (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
Pages to Include:
User Registration and Login: A page for users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
Profile Setup: A page where users can create and edit their profiles, specifying their role (mentor or mentee), skills, interests, and a brief bio.
User Discovery: A page where users can browse through other users' profiles, with filters for role, skills, interests, etc.
Matchmaking: A page that suggests potential mentorship matches based on user preferences and profile information.

Functionality:
User Authentication: Implement secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities with input validation and error handling.
Profile Management: Allow users to create, edit, and delete their profiles. Ensure that profile information is accurately displayed and updated.
Matching Algorithm: Develop a basic algorithm that suggests potential mentors or mentees based on matching skills and interests.
Connection Requests: Enable users to send and receive mentorship requests, accept or decline requests, and manage ongoing mentorship connections.
Notifications: Implement a simple notification system to inform users of new mentorship requests or updates.

Database Integration:
Setup: Use a relational database to store user information, profiles, and mentorship connections (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Relationships: Define clear relationships between users, their profiles, and mentorship requests.
Data Security: Ensure sensitive information is securely stored and handled, following best practices for data protection.

Edge Case Handling:
Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent empty fields, invalid data formats, and security vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
Duplicate Prevention: Prevent users from creating duplicate profiles or sending multiple mentorship requests to the same user.
No Matches Found: Gracefully handle scenarios where no mentorship matches are available by providing alternative suggestions or prompts to broaden search criteria.

Deployment:
Hosting: Deploy the application on a free hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, Netlify).
Accessibility: Ensure the deployed application is fully functional, responsive, and accessible via a public URL.
Environment Variables: Securely manage any API keys or environment variables needed for deployment.

Deliverables:
GitHub Repository: A public repository containing all source code, organized in a clean and logical structure.
Deployed Application URL: A live link to the deployed application for testing and review.
README File: Include setup instructions, the deployed URL, technologies used, and any necessary configurations.
Documentation: A brief document (approximately one page) explaining your development approach, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

Evaluation Criteria:
UI/UX Design: Clarity, aesthetics, and user-friendliness of the interface.
Feature Implementation: Complete and correct functionality as per the requirements.
Database Management: Efficient database design and interaction, ensuring data integrity and security.
Robustness: Effective handling of edge cases, errors, and invalid inputs without compromising the application's stability.
Code Quality: Cleanliness of code, use of best practices, commenting, and overall organization.
Innovation: Any additional features or creative solutions beyond the basic requirements.
